              lounges, and while we are not responsible to you if the nightclub
              or lounge does not, for whatever reason, provide the purchased
              Product to You, we ask that You contact us immediately at

              unable or unwilling to provide the purchased Product to You so
              that we may assist rectifying the situation. In any case You have
              no right to a refund from us, but we may in our sole discretion
              refund the purchase price of the Product or a portion thereof.

              POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
              LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR
              CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In
              no event shall NoTab’s total liability to you for all damages
              (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases
              involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars
              ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above
              stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

              If you have a dispute with one or more nightclubs, lounges or a
              merchant of a Product purchased through the App you release NoTab
              (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures

              consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
              arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you
              are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542,
              which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the
              creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
              time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
              materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
